1. Marketing Research Team
  1.1 As the marketing research team, I want clear examples of what items draw the users attention the most,
      the number of times it was clicked and then have the page create a nifty chart that does our thinking for us.

2. Focus Group Participant:
   2.1. As the focus group participant [FGP], I just want to be able to have a nice, friendly, easy user interface.
   2.2. I want the test to load seamlessly so that I can do the tests. Nothing breaks.
   2.3  I want it to tell me when I am done so that I can leave and collect my money.

3. Developer:
  3.1. As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site,
    so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand.
  3.2. I want to make my code as clean as possible so that I can hand the project off to future designers
      and not have to worry about creating an unmaintainable codebase.
      - This means making many, many comments and names that explain who/what they do in an effort to be self-documenting
  3.3 As a developer I want to build and test frequently in a test-driven environment
